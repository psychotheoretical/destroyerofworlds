*    basically,just don't be disrespectful about my kins and don't ask how or why i kin them (worse if you're not even a fictiokin yourself) bc idk how yo explain well,i do like explaining and writing/typing,but i don't express myself well when it's abt showing someone something i know (insecure stuff) and i know how to express myself more when it's literally just me knowing myself.
*    no I'm not faking it,i feel connected to characters or human people, could be anything even... specially since I'm an INTP (doesn't affect these stuff but just something to make clear)
*    yes, I'm Oppenheimer irl,pls call me by it or Robert idc i love it when someone does that! I'm not forcing,i have 2 names obviously...
